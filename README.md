# Predicting Categories of Averaged CIFAR-10 Images

This repository contains the implementation of a model designed to predict the categories of two component images created by averaging random samples from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project includes data generation, model training, and evaluation based on a specific metric.

## Problem Description

### Input
- Each input is an image obtained by averaging two random samples from CIFAR-10.
- The first image belongs to one of the first five CIFAR-10 categories:
  - Airplane
  - Automobile
  - Bird
  - Cat
  - Deer
- The second image belongs to one of the remaining five categories:
  - Dog
  - Frog
  - Horse
  - Ship
  - Truck

### Output
- The model outputs two labels:
  1. A label <5 for the first image category.
  2. A label >=5 for the second image category.

### Evaluation Metric
1. Calculate the classification accuracy for the two predicted labels.
2. Compute the average accuracy across the two predictions.
3. Evaluate the metric on **10,000 inputs** generated from the CIFAR-10 test dataset.
4. Repeat the evaluation **10 times** and report the **standard deviation** of the results.

## Dataset
- CIFAR-10: A dataset consisting of 60,000 images (50,000 for training, 10,000 for testing) across 10 classes.
- Classes:
  1. Airplane
  2. Automobile
  3. Bird
  4. Cat
  5. Deer
  6. Dog
  7. Frog
  8. Horse
  9. Ship
 10. Truck

## Implementation

### Data Generator
A data generator is provided to create inputs by averaging two random CIFAR-10 images:
- The first image is sampled from the first five classes.
- The second image is sampled from the remaining five classes.
- The generated dataset is split into training and evaluation sets.


### Training
- Train the model using the CIFAR-10 training data.
- Loss function: Multi-task classification loss 
- Optimizer: Adam 
- Monitor classification accuracy for both labels during training.

### Evaluation
1. Generate 10,000 test inputs using the provided data generator.
2. Evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy on the test set.
3. Repeat the evaluation 10 times.
4. Report the average accuracy and standard deviation.


### Results
The evaluation results, include average accuracy of 79.81% and standard deviation of 0.28%
